# Express app with nodemon development server

Use [nodemon's](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) legacy mode to monitor file changes in your container. The app will restart, if you change any **.js**, **.json** or **.hjs** file.

## Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your system.

* [Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/) for Mac OS X
* [Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) for Ubuntu Linux
* [Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for other platforms

Install [Fig](http://fig.sh) on your system.

* Homebrew (OS X): `brew install fig`
* Python/pip: `sudo pip install -U fig`
* Other: ``curl -L https://github.com/docker/fig/releases/download/1.0.0/fig-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/fig; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fig``

## Setup

Run `fig build`. It will

* install [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) globally in your container
* install all dependencies from the package.json locally
* expose port 3000 to the host
* instruct the container to execute `npm start` on start up.

## Start

Run `fig up` to create and start the container. The app should then be running on your docker daemon on port 3030 (On OS X you can use `boot2docker ip` to find out the IP address).
